This course is a four credit course which means that students are expected to do 12 - 12.5 hours of course-related work or activity each week.  This includes scheduled class times as well as time spent completing assigned readings, studying for weekly quizzes, completing exercises, preparing a community health profile, and other course-related tasks.  This course assumes no prior knowledge and is open to both majors and non-majors.  

## Course Description:
In an increasingly interconnected world, this course examines spatial patterns of economic activity, with particular attention focused on the unequal distribution of resources and economic activity both locally and globally.  In this course, we will explore the relationship of human settlement and activity to environmental factors; location theory, land use patterns, and social determinants of economic activity; globalization, economic development, and global commodity chains; and resource management and the geographic distribution of the environmental consequences of resource extraction, production processes, and consumption practices.  In this course we will use real world data to map patterns of production, retail, and consumption and the economic geography of carbon emissions globally.

## My Commitment
It is my intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs and intellectual development be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. I strive to make my teaching both accessible to, and inclusive of, all students regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, disability, veteran status, documentation, age, socio-economic status, political affiliations, national origin, and culture.

## Assessment
Students will be assessed based on four criteria

    **Participation: 20%**
    Students are expected to come to class prepared and to actively participate. There will regularly be in-class activities and discussions that will affect your participation grade and cannot be made up. An interactive class is much more fun and rewarding for all. What you get out of this course is directly related to what you give to the course, so please give generously! While participation and attendance are not the same thing (just because you are present does not mean you are participating), it is very difficult to participate without being in the room. I understand that we are all human and may have to miss class on occasion, so one or two absences will not affect your participation grade, but if you find that you are having to miss class on a regular basis, please come talk to me.

    **Weekly Quizzes:  15%**
    Students are asked to take a comprehension quiz each week based on that week’s material. There will be a total of 15 quizzes which will be posted to Brightspace each Friday at the end of class and will be due before class on Monday. The quizzes are not timed, but are designed to take no more than 10 minutes if you understand the course material. You are welcome to use your notes, readings, etc., but each student is asked to work alone (not in consultation with your classmates) and to do the work (i.e. do not type quiz questions into ChatGPT or other AI programs).
